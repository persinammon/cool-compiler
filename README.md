# COOL compiler
Compiler written in C++ to compile COOL (Classroom Object Oriented Language) 

Based on this lovely MOOC: [Compilers at Stanford, maybe from 2000's](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:StanfordOnline+SOE.YCSCS1+3T2020/home)

## Update and Final Verdict

Decided to desist and deprecate. I did a watered down compilers course with creating a lookup table/tokenizer/parser/maybe AST. I had no curiosity or much ability for professional level work in this domain. I believe there is no real reason to cross the boundary from software engineer to computer scientist without honest love for computer science and going full metal in what it takes.
